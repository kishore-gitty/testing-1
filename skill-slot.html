        <h1>ABOUT MY INTERNSHIP:</h1>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
        <p> During my internship, I focused on understanding solar energy and its technological developments, especially in the area of next-generation solar cells. The internship was primarily study-oriented, allowing me to explore the concepts, working principles, advantages, and limitations of solar energy systems in depth. This experience helped me build strong theoretical knowledge about how sunlight is converted into electricity and why renewable energy has become one of the most essential solutions for global sustainability. By studying solar technologies closely, I gained clarity on how material science, device design, and research instruments contribute to the future of clean energy.</p>


        <h2> SOLAR ENERGY – MAIN AREA OF STUDY</h2>
        <p>Solar energy formed the core of my internship, where I studied the evolution of solar cell technologies, starting from conventional silicon-based panels to advanced perovskite solar cells. I learned about the challenges faced by earlier solar technologies, such as high production cost, limited efficiency, and material limitations, and how modern research is overcoming these issues. My study covered light absorption mechanisms, photovoltaic principles, and how different materials influence the efficiency of solar devices. I also explored how solar energy systems are used in homes, industries, transportation, and large-scale power generation. This extensive theoretical study strengthened my understanding of renewable energy engineering and increased my interest in working with sustainable technologies. </p>

        <h2>ABOUT THE INSTITUTION </h2>
        <p>My internship was carried out at the Centre for Research and Development (CFRD), KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology. The institution offered a professional research atmosphere with well-equipped laboratories and supportive mentors. Although the internship was study-based, I had the chance to observe various scientific procedures, understand laboratory workflows, and learn the importance of using instruments correctly. Being in a research environment helped me develop discipline, scientific curiosity, and a deeper appreciation for how research teams operate in real life. </p>

        <h2>STUDY OF PEROVSKITES </h2>
        <p> I studied copper halide perovskites mainly from a theoretical perspective to understand why they are considered a promising alternative to traditional solar materials. My study included research papers, reference books, and discussions with mentors to understand the optical properties, bandgap behaviour, and stability challenges of perovskites. Instead of synthesizing materials, I focused on learning the concepts behind solution preparation, material crystallization, and how researchers evaluate samples using lab instruments.</p>

        <h2> INSTRUMENTS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS</h2>
        <p>My internship provided me with exposure to a wide range of advanced laboratory instruments. I worked with the probe sonicator and ultrasonicator to break down particles and obtain uniform dispersions. The magnetic stirrer helped in achieving consistent solution mixing, while the centrifuge machine was used to separate solid particles from liquid mixtures. I used the precision balance for accurate measurement of chemicals, which is crucial for material synthesis. One of the most important instruments I handled was the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) machine, which helped analyze the crystal structure of synthesized perovskite material. Learning to operate these instruments improved my technical expertise and understanding of how material properties are studied in research labs. </p>

        <h2>SCOPE FOR FUTURE LEARNING </h2>
        <p>Since my internship was purely academic and observational, it opened many opportunities for future practical work. I now have the theoretical foundation required to start working on real experiments involving material synthesis, film preparation, optical measurements, and device fabrication. The study experience has motivated me to explore renewable energy research further and possibly work on hands-on solar cell fabrication in the future. </p>
