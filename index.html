            <h1 class ="cert">Programming, data structures and algorithms using python-certification</h1>
            <P class="cert_p"> I successfully completed the NPTEL course on Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using Python, offered by IIT Madras during the July–September 2024 session. This intensive 8-week program provided a structured and in-depth understanding of fundamental and advanced concepts in Python programming. Throughout the course, I strengthened my knowledge of data structures, algorithmic design, problem-solving strategies, and the logical flow required for writing clean and efficient code. The curriculum also deepened my clarity in topics such as recursion, sorting techniques, searching methods, and the real-time application of different algorithms. Completing this certification demonstrates my strong skill in Python and my commitment to learning continuously, improving my technical abilities, and staying updated in the field of programming and computational thinking. </P>
